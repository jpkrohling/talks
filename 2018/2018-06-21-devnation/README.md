## Abstract

A significant challenge of moving from a traditional monolithic application design to a microservices-based architecture is the ability to monitor the business transaction flow of events throughout your entire distributed system. Join us for the next online DevNation Live on June 21st at 12pm EDT for Advanced Microservices Tracing with Jaeger, presented by Red Hat software engineers Pavol Loffay and Juraci Paix√£o Kr√∂hling.

In this session, we‚Äôll examine in detail the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) OpenTracing API, a consistent, expressive, vendor-neutral API for distributed tracing and context propagation. We will also analyse Jaeger, an open source distributed tracing system inspired by Google Dapper and OpenZipkin.

Join us to gain an understanding of Jaeger‚Äôs open source distributed tracing system and how it can help you monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based distributed systems.
