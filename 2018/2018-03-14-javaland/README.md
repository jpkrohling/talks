## Abstract

Microservices are now the standard for new architectures. Their distributed nature makes it harder to determine the causes of a performance bottleneck, as one canâ€™Â’t just watch a single process and see the big picture. In this talk, youâ€™Â’ll learn how to instrument a business application (Spring Boot, Vert.x, Wildfly Swarm) with the OpenTracing API and use a tracing backend solution like Jaeger and/or a metrics solution like Prometheus to find, fix, and measure performance improvements to our distributed application.
