  title: OTel Sucks (But Also Rocks!)
  description: >
    OpenTelemetry (OTel) has become a cornerstone of observability, but the journey hasn’t been without challenges. Inspired by the famous "Linux Sucks" format, this talk explores OTel’s pain points and highlights its successes.

    We’ll cover:
    * SDK Configuration: Once complex for simple scenarios, now simplified by the Config SIG.
    * Collector Challenges: Tail-sampling woes and Prometheus performance issues, balanced by OTel’s ability to handle multiple signals in one binary with great performance using OTLP.
    * Semantic Conventions: Painful changes, like in HTTP conventions, but with long-term benefits through unified standards.

    Featuring real-world user insights, this session delivers a brutally honest yet optimistic take on OTel’s evolution. Perfect for anyone navigating OpenTelemetry’s complexities or celebrating its strengths.

  description: >
    This is the official OpenTelemetry session at Kubecon. OpenTelemetry started with distributed traces and metrics, but the
    project's vision has always been to provide whatever signals are needed from infrastructure, services, and more. This
    session will focus on what's coming next, including new signals and sources. Join to learn about OpenTelemetry's new
    logging functionality, including its two logging paths, the benefits of each, and real-world production examples. We'll
    show the power of the next wave of OpenTelemetry enhancements, including profiling and the insights that this unlocks in
    combination with distributed traces, and how we're extending your observability to client applications. We'll wrap up with
    a Q&A of 10+ project maintainers, who can speak to these topics and more.

  title: "Real-World Sampling – Lessons Learned After Reducing ~80% of Our O11y Costs"
  description: >
    Application observability tools play a crucial role in the optimization of application performance. However, it can be costly
    when a good instrumentation strategy isn't in place. Without carefully selecting which data to keep, it can become a
    financial problem. With this in mind, Pismo considered some types of sampling, from vendor-specific solutions to open-source
    ones, and ended up landing at OpenTelemetry's Tail Sampling processor due to the flexibility of the policies that can be
    used, as well as its performance, reliability, and vendor neutrality. In this presentation, Juraci will talk about strategies
    to achieve a highly available tail-sampling setup, while Alexandre will show what his team did at Pismo to reduce their
    application observability costs by about 80% while keeping enough data to observe their applications adequately. At the end
    of this session, you'll learn why sampling is needed, what tail-sampling is, and the trade-offs to consider when planning
    its usage.

    Join the OpenTelemetry maintainers in making OpenTelemetry better for everyone. OpenTelemetry will have several opportunities
    to contribute. The OpenTelemetry Collector is vendor-agnostic implementation for receiving, processing and exporting telemetry
    data. The Collector is a large ecosystem, including individual components, a telemetry transformation language, helm charts,
    and a Kubernetes operator. Join the Collector maintainers and help fix bugs, add new features, and add new transformation
    functions. OpenTelemetry JavaScript is an OTel client written in typescript which supports traces, metrics, and logs, but an
    observability client is only as good as the telemetry it collects. Help the OTel JS maintainers update the instrumentation
    libraries and ensure they are outputting semantic convention-compliant telemetry data.

    Microservices are now the standard for new architectures. Their distributed nature makes it harder to determine the causes of
    a performance bottleneck, as one can't just watch a single process and see the big picture. In this talk, you'll learn how to
    instrument a business application (Spring Boot, Vert.x, Wildfly Swarm) with the OpenTracing API and use a tracing backend
    solution like Jaeger and/or a metrics solution like Prometheus to find, fix, and measure performance improvements to our
    distributed application.

  title: 'OpenTracing: One Instrumentation for Metrics, Logs and Distributed Tracing'
  description: >
    Understanding how your microservices based application is executing in a highly distributed and elastic cloud environment can
    be complicated. CNCF OpenTracing is a new standard to help provide observability within such an environment. With the help
    from Jaeger, an OpenTracing compatible distributed tracing system, we will show how instrumenting an application using the
    OpenTracing API can provide not only tracing information, showing the path of execution through a set of cooperating
    services, but also application metrics and contextualised logging information, to help diagnose problems in highly
    distributed applications.

  title: Operational and Business Insights from Tracing Distributed Microservices
  description: >
    In this talk we will present Hawkular APM, an OpenTracing-compliant community project. We will demonstrate how the project can
    be used to monitor microservices in a cloud environment, capturing trace and business metric information, which can then be
    presented in both aggregated and individual trace views to provide useful insight for many roles within an organisation.

    Microservice architecture brings new challenges for monitoring an application state and health in production environments. One
    of the necessary components for a successful operation is distributed tracing. In this presentation we will discuss the common
    complications of distributed tracing while exploring the emerging implementation-agnostic API OpenTracing. We'll use a sample
    application to extract business and operational insights based on tracing data.
