## Abstract

Join the OpenTelemetry maintainers in making OpenTelemetry better for everyone. OpenTelemetry will have several opportunities to contribute. The OpenTelemetry Collector is vendor-agnostic implementation for receiving, processing and exporting telemetry data. The Collector is a large ecosystem, including individual components, a telemetry transformation language, helm charts, and a Kubernetes operator. Join the Collector maintainers and help fix bugs, add new features, and add new transformation functions. OpenTelemetry JavaScript is an OTel client written in typescript which supports traces, metrics, and logs, but an observability client is only as good as the telemetry it collects. Help the OTel JS maintainers update the instrumentation libraries and ensure they are outputting semantic convention-compliant telemetry data.
