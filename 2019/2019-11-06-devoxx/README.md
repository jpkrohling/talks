## Abstract

Service mesh tools, such as Istio and Linkerd, are being used to remove some of the networking complexity from our microservicesâ€™ code. In exchange for that, we give up some of the ability to observe the networking decisions being made, turning our service mesh into an apparent chaos.

In this talk, weâ€™ll demonstrate how distributed tracing can be applied to take back some of the information we lost when we delegated the networking decisions to the service mesh.

Weâ€™ll begin with a short introduction to service meshes and distributed tracing, followed by a quick overview of the tools weâ€™ll use: Istio and Jaeger.

Weâ€™ll then deploy an application composed of a few microservices and explore what distributed tracing can tell us about the individual requests arriving at our application.

Weâ€™ll wrap up the session with a Q&A.

Youâ€™ll leave the session knowing the observability compromises you are making when adopting a service mesh tool and how to address some of them.

Youâ€™ll get the most of this session if you have some familiarity with Kubernetes already.
