## Abstract

Jaeger is a distributed tracing platform, providing a way to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems. In the first part, weâ€™ll introduce you to Jaeger, showing what it is capable of. Weâ€™ll deploy a few microservices into a Kubernetes cluster and use distributed tracing to help us see whatâ€™s going on. After this brief demo, youâ€™ll learn how to engage with the community and how to make your first contribution to the project. In the second part of this talk, weâ€™ll explain in details what are all the moving pieces and how they work together. Youâ€™ll also learn about the different deployment strategies and advanced configuration options. And finally, weâ€™ll have a Q&A session at the end with project maintainers.
