## Abstract

Deploying OpenTelemetry Collector on Kubernetes is straightforward with Helm charts and the Operator. However, achieving a robust and production-quality observability pipeline requires thoughtful configuration and experimentation.

In this talk, Juraci and Yuri draw from their real-world experience to guide you through the process of designing and implementing telemetry pipelines in Kubernetes. They delve into the intricacies of building resilient pipelines with OpenTelemetry Collector by exploring through a live demo around topics like the load-balancing exporter, memory-limiting and batching processors, as well as the internal sending queues, delivering a production-ready telemetry pipeline.

By attending this talk, you will get a deep understanding of common strategies for designing telemetry pipelines in Kubernetes and the practical knowledge to apply them effectively to your specific requirements.
