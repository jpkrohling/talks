## Abstract

This is the official OpenTelemetry session at Kubecon. OpenTelemetry started with distributed traces and metrics, but the project's vision has always been to provide whatever signals are needed from infrastructure, services, and more. This session will focus on what's coming next, including new signals and sources. Join to learn about OpenTelemetry's new logging functionality, including its two logging paths, the benefits of each, and real-world production examples. We'll show the power of the next wave of OpenTelemetry enhancements, including profiling and the insights that this unlocks in combination with distributed traces, and how we're extending your observability to client applications. We'll wrap up with a Q&A of 10+ project maintainers, who can speak to these topics and more.
