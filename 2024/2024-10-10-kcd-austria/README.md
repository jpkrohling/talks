## Abstract

As cloud native technologies become increasingly prevalent, the need for robustness, scalability, and efficiency in these systems is more critical than ever. Observability serves as a cornerstone in meeting these demands by offering profound insights into the behavior of applications and their underlying infrastructure. This keynote will delve into the essential elements of observability within cloud native environments, emphasizing the comprehensive visibility it affords into complex and dynamic systems. We will also explore the cultural shifts encouraged by observability, highlighting how it fosters a proactive approach to system management and optimization. Join us to uncover how deep observability can transform your cloud native strategy, ensuring your infrastructure not only meets current demands but is also primed for future challenges.
