## Abstract

The session introduces an open standard for assessing OpenTelemetry data quality, consistency, and completeness. Speakers explain how the Instrumentation Score helps practitioners "collect excellent telemetry" and identifies gaps in observability practices, moving beyond mere data collection toward actionable insights.
