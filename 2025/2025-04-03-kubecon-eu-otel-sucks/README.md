## Abstract

OpenTelemetry (OTel) has become a cornerstone of observability, but the journey hasnâ€™t been without challenges. Inspired by the famous "Linux Sucks" format, this talk explores OTelâ€™s pain points and highlights its successes.

Weâ€™ll cover:
* SDK Configuration: Once complex for simple scenarios, now simplified by the Config SIG.
* Collector Challenges: Tail-sampling woes and Prometheus performance issues, balanced by OTelâ€™s ability to handle multiple signals in one binary with great performance using OTLP.
* Semantic Conventions: Painful changes, like in HTTP conventions, but with long-term benefits through unified standards.

Featuring real-world user insights, this session delivers a brutally honest yet optimistic take on OTelâ€™s evolution. Perfect for anyone navigating OpenTelemetryâ€™s complexities or celebrating its strengths.
