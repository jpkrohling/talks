## Abstract

The presentation addresses problems with poor-quality telemetry data. As described, "Much telemetry is bad: noisy, costly, and hides real signals." The speakers examine issues like auto-instrumentation noise and verbose traces, then demonstrate solutions using OpenTelemetry Collector configurations to filter and improve data quality at the pipeline level.
