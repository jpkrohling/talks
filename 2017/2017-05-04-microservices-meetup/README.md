## Abstract

Microservice architecture brings new challenges for monitoring an application state and health in production environments. One of the necessary components for a successful operation is distributed tracing. In this presentation we will discuss the common complications of distributed tracing while exploring the emerging implementation-agnostic API OpenTracing. Weâ€™ll use a sample application to extract business and operational insights based on tracing data.
