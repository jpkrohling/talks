## Abstract

Microservice architecture brings new challenges for monitoring of an application state and health in production environments. One of the necessary components for successful operation is distributed tracing.
In this presentation we will discuss the common complications of distributed tracing while exploring the emerging implementation-agnostic API OpenTracing. Weâ€™ll use a sample application extracting business and operational insights based on tracing data.
