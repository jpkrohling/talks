## Abstract

Distributed tracing is a tool that belongs to every developer's tool belt, but what it actually can do remains a mystery to most developers.

In this slideless talk, we will introduce you to the world of distributed tracing by developing a cloud native application from scratch and applying all important distributed tracing concepts in practice, at first by hand and then by using existing libraries to automate our work.

You will learn not only what distributed tracing is, but how it works, what it can do and what it canâ€™t. By the end of this talk, you will have working knowledge to start using distributed tracing tools with your new projects, as well as with your legacy ones.
