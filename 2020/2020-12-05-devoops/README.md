## Abstract

Distributed tracing has become a mandatory tool in every SRE's tool belt, but do you know enough to effectively use and manage a distributed tracing architecture? This talk will guide you through the components required to have a production-quality distributed tracing setup, including a quick demo showing what we want our tracing solution to tell us, followed by a discussion on the architecture of one of the most popular open source tracing solutions: Jaeger. We'll see how we can deploy it on bare metal and Kubernetes with Helm Charts, as well as with the Jaeger Operator, wrapping up with how we can observe our Jaeger instance by looking at the metrics it exposes. You'll leave this session knowing how to set up a world-class tracing solution.
