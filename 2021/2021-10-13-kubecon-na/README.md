## Abstract

The OpenTelemetry Collector is a versatile piece of software and can be deployed in numerous ways. In this talk, we‚Äôll explore some of these patterns, starting with the classic ‚Äúagent and collector‚Äù and landing at ‚Äúscalable tail-based sampling,‚Äù talking about ‚Äúmulti-tenancy‚Äù along the way. We‚Äôll see how they look in theory and practice with live demos on a real Kubernetes cluster. You‚Äôll leave this session with knowledge about some of the essential processors for the OpenTelemetry Collector, how to employ them individually, and as part of a vaster deployment topology.
