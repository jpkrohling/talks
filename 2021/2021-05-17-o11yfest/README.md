## Abstract

Sampling is still one of the biggest challenges in distributed tracing. While the basic concept is easy to grasp, the number of choices and their trade-offs requires learning about the techniques and your own workload. In this session, we are giving you all the knowledge required to master the sampling techniques: we‚Äôll talk about head and tail-based sampling, as well as adaptive sampling, and we‚Äôll wrap it up with a bonus discussion on trace aggregation. You‚Äôll leave this session ready to implement scenarios, from the simple ‚Äúprobabilistic head-sampling‚Äù up to the complex ‚Äúscalable tail-based sampling‚Äù using open source tools like OpenTelemetry Collector.
