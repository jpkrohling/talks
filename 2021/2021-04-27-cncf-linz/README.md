## Abstract

OpenTelemetry is one of the newest projects in the realm of Observability at the CNCF and is already the second most active project there. In this session, Juraci PaixÃ£o KrÃ¶hling will talk about the different subprojects and how to get started using them. Even if you heard about OpenTelemetry before, you'll leave this session with a better understanding of what this is all about, the several faces of OpenTelemetry, and what you can do to make your projects more observable.
